# Early Prediction of Sepsis From Clinical data (PhysioNet Challenge 2019)

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality.
The goal of [PhysioNet Challenge 2019](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/) is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data.
